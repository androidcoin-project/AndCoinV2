# The AndCoinV2 

AndCoinV2 is a POW/POS mineable cryptocurrency with Masternodes, based on a secure A5A algorithm.

AndCoinV2 is dependent upon libsecp256k1 by sipa, the sources for which can be found here:
https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1

AndCoinV2 includes an Address Index feature, based on the address index API (searchrawtransactions RPC command) implemented in Bitcoin Core but modified implementation to work with the AndCoinV2 codebase (PoS coins maintain a txindex by default for instance).

Initialize the Address Index By Running with -reindexaddr Command Line Argument. It may take 10-15 minutes to build the initial index.

Main futures:
ASIC Resistance
Cpuminer
Mobile miner
Instamine Protection
Wallet Built-in Block Explorer
Masternode Reward Protection
Easy Masternode Setup
Long-Term Development & Support
